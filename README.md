# UNIVERSITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM-FS mini project VTU
  The University Management System (UMS) is a comprehensive software platform that transforms and 
  simplifies various user operations. It allows users to perform various operations
 such as adding records of colleges, deleting records, modifying records, searching for colleges
 based on different criteria, and sorting the records. The code utilizes file handling to store the
 college records in separate files.
 Users can search for colleges based on rank, name, city, or eligibility rank. The search methods
 iterate through the record file and display the matching records. The sorting methods use bubble
 Sort to sort the records based on rank, name, or eligibility rank in ascending or descending order.
 Overall, the code provides basic functionality for managing college records, allowing users to
 add, delete, modify, search, and sort the records effectively.
 The University Management System undertaken as a project is based on relevant
 technologies. This project has been developed to carry out the processes easily and quickly, which
 is impossible with the manual systems, which are overcome by this software. This project is
 developed using Python language and executed in codeblocks and files at the s backend.
